* [VisPy](http://vispy.org) - VisPy is a high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization 
library leveraging the computational power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) 
through the OpenGL library to display very large datasets.
* [Altair](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair) - declarative statistical visualization 
library for Python.
* [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) - Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library 
that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise 
construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this capability with 
high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.
* [Mayavi](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/) - 3D Scientific Data Visualization and Plotting.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.github.io/) - Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. 
It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
* [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) - Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation 
and statistical analysis of graphs (a.k.a. networks).
* [holoviews](http://holoviews.org) - HoloViews is a Python library that makes analyzing and 
visualizing scientific or engineering data much simpler, more intuitive, and more easily 
reproducible. Without HoloViews, there are typically many steps required before you can 
see your data, whether you use a GUI interactively or write a function or script to build up 
a plot. HoloViews instead lets you store your data in an annotated format that is instantly 
visualizable, with immediate access to both the numeric data and its visualization.
