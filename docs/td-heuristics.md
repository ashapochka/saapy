* code implements architectural concerns, patterns, or addresses quality attributes
* points of integration with complex, dirty, or architecturally misaligned external API
* asynchronous implementations
* comparatively big number of bugs is traced to particular part of the code
* high complexity value for this part of the code
* cyclic dependencies involving this part of code
* code is too frequently refactored
* "small" bug fix or feature request requires code modifications in too many places
* build process takes too long and/or often fails
* bug fix frequently introduces a new bug or is rejected
* existing additional levels of abstraction fail to display clear benefit or justification
* too many adapters
* implementation relies on unstable or immature external or internal dependencies
* lack of consistency in pattern selection to implement the same types of tasks
