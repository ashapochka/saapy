# SAApy - System Architecture Assessment Toolkit

The assessment toolkit provides a set of tools implemented in python helping
build a graph from software system artifacts such as source code structures,
dependencies, issues, commit history, and others, and analyze the software
system for its quality and technical debt based on this graph.

The framework is a research tool and is not of stable production quality yet.
